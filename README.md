# Voice100 Runtime

Voice100 Android App is a TTS/ASR sample app that uses 
[ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/),
[WORLD](https://github.com/mmorise/World)
and [Voice100](https://github.com/kaiidams/voice100) neural TTS/ASR models
on Python.
Inference of Voice100 is low cost as its models are tiny and only depend
on CNN without recursion.
